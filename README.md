Common Object File Format Inspector

WARNING under development and is probably broken at any given time

This is a cross-platform (primarily Linux) application for analyzing the structure of a Windows PE file.

It is primarily meant for me to learn indepth, the PE file structure

Once the PE file portion is complete, I am planning to extend it to ELF and Mach-O files.

In learning malware analysis, I have run into situations where it was necessary to hop back and forth from REMNUX to FLARE while analyzing a file. On Windows, there are several analyzers such as PEBear. I could not locate a similar application for Linux.
